# Role Request Voting Bot

Watches a forum channel for new threads, then posts a message in the thread where users can vote on the role request.
Waits a certain amount of time and then ends the voting period, handing out the role if needed. Updates the original message with results.
Moderators and Paragons (highest role) can end votes early with their outcome of choice. This effectively allows Paragons to retain veto power on role requests.

Help welcome!

Feel free to suggest new features on the Discord. I might make a branch testing the prediction market integration.
