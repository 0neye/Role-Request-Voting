# Role Request Voting Bot

Watches a forum channel for new threads, then posts a message in the thread where users can vote on the role request.
Waits a certain amount of time and then ends the voting period, handing out the role if needed. Updates the original message with results.

Examples below with a normal thread. (Forum channels aren't possible on a private server)

Uses [Pycord](https://pycord.dev/), which is the 'discord' import.

Help welcome. Needs doc strings and more type annotations. Some more polish is also welcome.

Feel free to suggest new features on the discord. I might make a branch testing the prediction market integration.
